      " Yesterday, after landing from Paris, the Botswana Olympic Team had the honour of being transported in a Hotel on Wheels literally, a hotel on wheels. The bus, which took the team from Sir Seretse Khama Airport to the stadium, offers a unique service, the first of its kind in Botswanaâ€”a moving hotel.Speaking to this publication, the driver, Raymond Shumba, said that as a team, they pledged to transport  the Olympic team as their first client. Shumba further revealed that it took a year to transform the bus into its current state. The bus, which operates on solar energy and is equipped with beds, a stove, a fridge, showers, and more, is set to be officially launched in two weeks. We had to pledge to give them the first experience, and I must say it was a great experience driving such icons, concluded Shumba.",
